# Biodiversity in National Parks
For this project, you will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

You will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings about the National Park Service.

# Questions

- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?

# Analysis

In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include: 

1. Distributions
1. counts
1. relationship between species
1. conservation status of species
1. observations of species in parks.
